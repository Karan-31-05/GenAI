The video creators had previously praised these initiatives but now criticize the lack of transparency and updates on their progress, especially compared to the success of UPI (Unified Payments Interface). They express concern that the lack of information suggests these projects have stalled and call on the government to provide updates, whether positive or negative, to keep the public informed.\n"

The video creators had previously praised these initiatives but now criticize the lack of transparency and updates regarding their progress, especially compared to the success of UPI (Unified Payments Interface).  They call on the government to provide more information so the public can understand what's working and what's not.  They also express concern that the lack of updates suggests these initiatives may have stalled or failed.\n"
